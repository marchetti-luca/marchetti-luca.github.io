My main research interest is the extraction of continuum physics from quantum gravity, focusing in particular on the emergence of cosmological and black hole spacetimes. I am also interested in renormalization and in the definition of physical notions of localization and evolution through the relational strategy, both issues being central to study and describe emergent continuum physics within quantum gravity.
